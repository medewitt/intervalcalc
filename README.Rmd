## Installation

You can install the released version of intervalcalc from [r-universe](https://medewitt.r-universe.dev/ui#builds) with

``` r
options(repos = c(
    medewitt = 'https://medewitt.r-universe.dev',
    CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
install.packages("intervalcalc")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("medewitt/intervalcalc")
```

You will also need to have a working installation of CmdStanR. 
This can be downloaded and installed using:

```r
install.packages("cmdstanr", 
    repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", 
    getOption("repos")))
```


Then you can install CmdStan using the following code from within a new R session:

```r
library(cmdstanr)
check_cmdstan_toolchain()
install_cmdstan()
```

Full details are available at [the CmdStanR website](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html).
